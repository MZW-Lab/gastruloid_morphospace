This folder contains all of the Python and MATLAB code from our manuscript entitled "An explainable map of human gastruloid morphospace reveals gastrulation failure modes and predicts teratogens".
All of the code and necessary files are included in sub-folders.
"Dimensionality-Reduction" contains the Python code for generating the map of morphospace.
"Gastruloid Analysis" contains the MATLAB code for analyzing IF images of drug-treated gastruloids.
"Modeling morphogen dynamics and cell fate" contains the Python code for running our mathematical model of morphogen spread and corresponding cell fate rules.
"Neural Network for learning the tSNE embedding" contains the Python code for training a neural network to learn the tSNE embedding.
"Wnt analysis and kymograph generation" contains the Python code for analyzing Wnt signaling in gastruloids.
